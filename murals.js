It was produced by Blameless Collective through local community consultation and was also the first large-scale mural to be installed in Leith for almost three decades, kickstarting a new association with public art in the area. The mural launch in July 2013 included a street party for local residents with speeches, DJs and free daal courtesy of Sikh Sanjog.</p>",
